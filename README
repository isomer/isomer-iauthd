               Undernet IRC Authentication Daemon for ircu2.10.12+
               ===================================================

SUMMARY
-------

undernet-iauthd is an IRC Authentication Daemon for undernet's ircu2.10.12+
server.  It handles requests from the IRC server for all new clients, passing
back information on whether to accept or reject the connection.


FEATURES
--------

* frees more time for ircd to handle chat instead of authentication
* can be run on a remote system via pipes (e.g. via SSH)
* klines based on any combination of host, ip, nick, user, realname
* unlimited DNS blacklist checks, with full response checking and option to
  pass an indentifier (or possibly URL) to the client when rejected.
* regular expression based klines - for drone rejections
* forced challenge/response for IP blocks in configuration file
* forced challenge/response for non-idented clients from any IP
* full IP exceptions from all checks


PREREQUISITES
-------------

undernet-iauthd requires ircu2.10.12+.  It is unlikely to work (and possibly
cause crashes) with versions before ircu2.10.12.11 - you have been warned!

libpcre (perl-compatible regular expression library) is required only if you
wish to use regex matching.  If the library is not found, regex checking will
be disabled.

At the time of writing, undernet-iauthd has been tested with the following
operating system/compiler configurations:

FreeBSD/i386 gcc3 + gcc4
FreeBSD/amd64 gcc3 + gcc4
FreeBSD/sparc64 gcc4.2.1
Linux (Debian) 4.0 gcc4
Solaris 10 x86 gcc3

It should work on 32 or 64-bit platforms and its cache files can be transported
between architectures safely (e.g. in the case of a server upgrade/migration)


COMPILING
---------

After extracting this source code, simply run ./configure and tell it where you
would like to install the daemon - for example:

./configure --prefix=/home/ircd/iauthd

If you wish to use regex, also add "--with-pcre" or "--with-pcre=<path-to-pcre>"

After configure completes, run "make" and "make install".

Installation will copy a set of sample configuration files to the prefix folder.
These files are suffixed with ".sample" to avoid overwriting any live config.


IRCU CONFIGURATION
------------------

To use the authentication daemon, you will need to edit your ircd.conf file.
Assuming you installed into /home/ircd/iauthd, here is an example:

IAuth {
	program = "/home/ircd/iauthd/bin/iauthd";
};

If you wish to make use of remote execution via SSH, it is recommended that
you create a shell script (e.g. iauthd.sh) containing (for example):

    #!/bin/sh
    /usr/bin/ssh -l <username> -q <hostname> /home/ircd/iauthd/bin/iauthd

And using the following ircd.conf example:

IAuth {
	program = "/home/ircd/iauthd.sh";
};

NOTE: you do NOT need to 'start' iauthd - it is started by ircd automatically!


MAINTENANCE
-----------

If you modify any configuration file, you can force undernet-iauthd to reload
its configuration by sending a USR1 signal to it.  Any configuration errors
will appear to IRC operators on the local server.

undernet-iauthd will periodically save it's caches.  This will reduce the load
on the daemon should it restart for any reason.  The daemon will also attempt
to save its caches if it is terminated for any reason (e.g. ircd crashes)


STATISTICS
----------

You can obtain statistics from the daemon via IRC by sending:

/stats iauth

as an IRC operator.  This will report information about number of connections,
kills, connections per second as well as a memory breakdown for internal
structures.  You can also see the pcre library version (if supported)
